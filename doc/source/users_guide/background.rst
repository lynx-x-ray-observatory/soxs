Background Models in SOXS
=========================

SOXS simulates background for every observation. The background in SOXS is
comprised of three components: a uniform galactic foreground, a point-source
background, and an instrumental/particle background. The former two components
are not tied to any particular instrument specification, whereas the latter
depends on the instrument being simulated. We will describe each of these
background components in turn.

.. _foreground:

Galactic Foreground Model
-------------------------

Two models for the galactic foreground are available in SOXS, ``"default"``
and ``"halosat"``. The

The ``"default"`` Foreground Model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``"default"`` galactic foreground component is modeled as a sum of two
thermal models with thermal broadening of emission lines, one absorbed,
``bapec+tbabs*bapec``, with parameters:

``tbabs*bapec`` **Model 1, Hot Halo**

* ``nH``: :math:`0.018 \times 10^{22}~\rm{cm}^{-2}`
* ``kT``: :math:`\rm{0.225~keV}`
* ``abund``: :math:`\rm{1.0~Z_\odot}`
* ``redshift``: :math:`0.0`
* ``norm``: :math:`\rm{7.3 \times 10^{-7}~10^{-14}\frac{\int{n_en_HdV}}{4{\pi}D_A^2(1+z)^2}}`

``bapec`` **Model 2, Local Hot Bubble**

* ``kT``: :math:`\rm{0.099~keV}`
* ``abund``: :math:`\rm{1.0~Z_\odot}`
* ``redshift``: :math:`0.0`
* ``norm``: :math:`\rm{1.7 \times 10^{-6}~10^{-14}\frac{\int{n_en_HdV}}{4{\pi}D_A^2(1+z)^2}}`

This model is from `McCammon et al. (2002) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...576..188M>`_.

The ``"halosat"`` Foreground Model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``"halosat"`` foreground model is the same as the ``"default"``, except that it
includes an additional absorbed thermal model (with ``tbabs``) for the Hot Halo,
based on HaloSat observations:

``tbabs*bapec`` **Model 3, Hot Halo**

* ``nH``: :math:`0.018 \times 10^{22}~\rm{cm}^{-2}`
* ``kT``: :math:`\rm{0.7~keV}`
* ``abund``: :math:`\rm{1.0~Z_\odot}`
* ``redshift``: :math:`0.0`
* ``norm``: :math:`\rm{8.76 \times 10^{-8}~10^{-14}\frac{\int{n_en_HdV}}{4{\pi}D_A^2(1+z)^2}}`

In either case, the background is diffuse and uniformly fills the entire field of
view of the instrument you choose to simulate. The absorption model, neutral hydrogen
column density, the abundance for the hot halo components, or the APEC version for the
foreground can be changed. One can also add velocity broadening to the emission lines
for the hot halo components. For more information, see :ref:`config`.

.. note::

    The power-law component from unresolved point sources is not included in this
    model since it is modeled separately in SOXS, as we detail next.

.. _ptsrc-bkgnd:

Point Source Background Model
-----------------------------

Another astrophysical component of the background in SOXS comes from resolved
point sources. The emission of these sources is assumed to originate from
cosmologically distant AGN and galaxies. The fluxes for these sources are drawn
from :math:`\rm{log}~N-\rm{log}~S` distributions taken from
`Lehmer et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...752...46L>`_'s
study of the *Chandra* Deep Field South. The point sources have fluxes in the
0.5-2 keV band in the :math:`7.63 \times 10^{-22} - 1.0 \times 10^{-12}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1}~\rm{cm}^{-2}`
range.

Each point source is given a power-law spectrum. Galaxies are assumed to have a
spectral index of :math:`\alpha = 2.0`. The spectral indices of AGN sources are
drawn from a fit to the spectral index distribution of sources given in
Figure 13a of `Hickox & Markevitch 2006 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...645...95H>`_.
Sources are absorbed by foreground Galactic neutral hydrogen assuming a neutral
hydrogen column of :math:`n_H = 0.018 \times 10^{22}~\rm{cm}^{-2}` and the ``wabs``
model by default. The absorption model and the value of the hydrogen column can
be changed using the :ref:`config`. The position of each point source is uniformly
randomly distributed within the field of view. A uniform background across the field
of view, associated with many completely unresolved point sources, is also added,
with a spectral index of :math:`\alpha = 2.0` and a flux of
:math:`1.352 \times 10^{-12}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1}~\rm{cm}^{-2}~\rm{deg}^{-2}` in the
0.5-2 keV band.

Though a point-source population is automatically created as a background
component when an observation is simulated, one can also create a SIMPUT catalog
of point sources using the same machinery, with the ability more finely control
the input parameters of the model. For more information, see
:ref:`point-source-catalog`.

.. _instr-bkgnd:

Instrumental Background
-----------------------

Each instrument specification in the SOXS instrument registry has a default
instrumental/particle background given by its ``"bkgnd"`` entry, which specifies
a PHA file for the background count rate, and the area in square arcminutes that
the background in the file was created with:

.. code-block:: python

    from soxs import get_instrument_from_registry
    hdxi = get_instrument_from_registry("lynx_hdxi")
    print(hdxi)

.. code-block:: pycon

    {
        "name": "lynx_hdxi",
        "arf": "xrs_hdxi_3x10.arf",
        "rmf": "xrs_hdxi.rmf",
        "bkgnd": ["lynx_hdxi_particle_bkgnd.pha", 1.0],
        "fov": 22.0,
        "num_pixels": 4096,
        "aimpt_coords": [0.0, 0.0],
        "chips": [["Box", 0, 0, 4096, 4096]],
        "focal_length": 10.0,
        "dither": True,
        "psf": ["image", "chandra_psf.fits", 6],
        "imaging": True,
        "grating": False
    }

The background model FITS table file must contain (at minimum) an extension
named ``"SPECTRUM"`` which has a table of two columns: (1) instrument channels
(must be the same as those in the RMF) and (2) either counts or count rate.
The HDU containing the spectrum must also have the exposure time of the
simulated spectrum in seconds stored in the ``"EXPOSURE"`` item in the header.

The ``"bkgnd"`` entry can also be set to ``None``, which corresponds to no
particle background. To change the particle background, one would need to
define a new instrument specification with a different background.

.. _adjust-bkgnd:

Adjusting Background Components
-------------------------------

All components of the background are turned on in the instrument simulator by
default. The various components of the background can be turned on or off
entirely in the call to :func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` by setting
the parameters ``ptsrc_bkgnd``, ``foreground``, and/or ``instr_bkgnd`` to
``True`` or ``False``:

.. code-block:: python

    # turn off the astrophysical foreground
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, foreground=False)

.. code-block:: python

    # turn off the instrumental background
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, instr_bkgnd=False)

.. code-block:: python

    # turn off all backgrounds
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, ptsrc_bkgnd=False,
                              instr_bkgnd=False, foreground=False)

If you want to change the neutral hydrogen column used for the background point
sources, set the ``bkg_nH`` (default value is 0.05) in the call to
:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`:

.. code-block:: python

    # change the value of the neutral hydrogen column
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, bkg_nH=0.02)

You can also make other adjustments to the point-source background in terms
of either turning off the diffuse unresolved component by setting
``diffuse_unresolved=False`` (not recommended), or by dropping some of the
brightest sources by setting the ``drop_brightest`` argument to an integer
(the latter is a poor-person's version of removing point sources from
observations):

.. code-block:: python

    # turn off the diffuse unresolved CXB and drop the 50 brightest sources
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, diffuse_unresolved=False,
                              drop_brightest=50)

One can also take finer control of the point-source contribution to the
background by supplying an ASCII table of point-source properties generated by
:func:`~soxs.background.point_sources.make_point_sources_file` or
:func:`~soxs.background.point_sources.make_point_source_list`
using the ``input_pt_sources`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

    # supply a list of point sources
    fov = 20.0 # arcmin
    soxs.make_point_source_list('my_ptsrc.dat', fov, sky_center)
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, input_pt_sources="my_ptsrc.dat")

See :ref:`point-source-list` for more information on this feature.

You can also adjust the overall normalization of the instrument background by
adjusting the keyword argument ``instr_bkgnd_scale``, which has a default value of 1:

.. code-block:: python

    soxs.instrument_simulator(out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center,
                              overwrite=True, instr_bkgnd_scale=0.5)

.. _make-bkgnd:

Using a Background From an Event File
-------------------------------------

Creating a new background every time SOXS is run may be time-consuming for
long exposures. SOXS provides a way to generate background events for a
particular instrument, save them to a standard event file, and then use this
file as input to :func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator`. The
:func:`~soxs.instrument.make_background_file` allows for this:

.. code-block:: python

    out_file = 'bkgnd_evt.fits'
    exp_time = (1.0, "Ms")
    instrument = "hdxi"
    sky_center = [24., 12.] # degrees
    soxs.make_background_file(out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center,
                              overwrite=True, foreground=True, instr_bkgnd=False,
                              ptsrc_bkgnd=True)

As can be noted from this example, :func:`~soxs.instrument.make_background_file`
allows one to turn any of the three background components on or off using the
boolean arguments ``foreground``, ``instr_bkgnd``, or ``ptsrc_bkgnd``.

You can also make other adjustments to the point-source background in terms
of either turning off the diffuse unresolved component by setting
``diffuse_unresolved=False`` (not recommended), or by dropping some of the
brightest sources by setting the ``drop_brightest`` argument to an integer
(the latter is a poor-person's version of removing point sources from
observations):

.. code-block:: python

    # turn off the diffuse unresolved CXB and drop the 50 brightest sources
    soxs.make_background_file(out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center,
                              overwrite=True, diffuse_unresolved=False,
                              drop_brightest=50)

One can also take finer control of the point-source contribution to the
background by supplying an ASCII table of point-source properties generated by
:func:`~soxs.background.point_sources.make_point_sources_file` or
:func:`~soxs.background.point_sources.make_point_source_list`
using the ``input_pt_sources`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

    fov = 20.0 # arcmin
    out_file = 'bkgnd_evt.fits'
    exp_time = (1.0, "Ms")
    instrument = "hdxi"
    sky_center = [24., 12.] # degrees
    soxs.make_point_source_list('my_ptsrc.dat', fov, sky_center)
    soxs.make_background_file(out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center,
                              overwrite=True, input_pt_sources='my_ptsrc.dat')

See :ref:`point-source-list` for more information on this feature.

You can also adjust the overall normalization of the instrument background by
adjusting the keyword argument ``instr_bkgnd_scale``, which has a default value of 1:

.. code-block:: python

    soxs.make_background_file(out_file, exp_time, instrument, sky_center,
                              overwrite=True, instr_bkgnd_scale=0.5)

:func:`~soxs.instrument.instrument_simulator` can use this background file when
it is supplied with the ``bkgnd_file`` argument, provided that the same
instrument is used and the exposure time of the source observation is not longer
than the exposure time that the background was run with:

.. code-block:: python

    exp_time = (500.0, "ks") # smaller than the original value
    instrument = "hdxi"
    simput_file = "beta_model_simput.fits"
    out_file = "evt.fits"
    sky_center = [30., 45.]
    soxs.instrument_simulator(simput_file, out_file, exp_time, instrument,
                              sky_center, overwrite=True, bkgnd_file="bkgnd_evt.fits")

Note that the pointing of the background event file does not to be the same as
the source pointing--the background events will be re-projected to match the
pointing of the source.
