Installation
============

SOXS and its dependencies are installed as a standard Python package, and it is
compatible with Python 3.9 and higher. You may use ``pip`` to install it (if
you do not have pip, check that your executable is not named ``pip3``, otherwise
visit https://pip.pypa.io/ to download it):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install soxs

If the Python distribution is not "owned" by you on your machine you might have
to call ``sudo pip install soxs``. If you need to upgrade from a previous
version of SOXS, issue ``[sudo] pip install -U soxs`` from the command line.

If you use `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview>`_, you
may install SOXS using ``conda``:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge soxs

These methods install both the Python interface and the command-line scripts.

Of course, you can always clone the source from
`GitHub <https://github.com/lynx-x-ray-observatory/soxs>`_ and install it
manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lynx-x-ray-observatory/soxs
    cd soxs
    pip install .

or run ``pip install -e .`` instead if you want to make changes to the
code and see them reflected without recompiling (though if you make updates to
the command-line scripts you will have to run ``pip install -e .``
again).

.. warning::

    SOXS is not currently compatible with NumPy 2.0, but will be in a future release.

SOXS Dependencies
=================

SOXS has the following Python dependencies:

* `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_
* `AstroPy <https://www.astropy.org>`_
* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_
* `h5py <https://www.h5py.org>`_
* `tqdm <https://github.com/noamraph/tqdm>`_
* `regions <https://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/>`_
* `pooch <https://www.fatiando.org/pooch>`_

Using any installation method, these dependencies should automatically install
(if you do not already have them) provided you are connected to the internet.

Optional Packages
=================

There are also a number of optional packages which may be used with SOXS to
enhance its capabilities.

* To make mock X-ray observations from 3D hydrodynamics models and other models
  of astrophysical sources, use the
  `pyXSIM <http://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/~jzuhone/pyxsim>`_ package with SOXS.
* To make mosaics of SOXS observations (see :ref:`mosaic`), install the
  `reproject <https://reproject.readthedocs.io>`_ package.
